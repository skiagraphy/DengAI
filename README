# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread

This project explores the **DengAI** time series forecasting challenge, predicting dengue fever case counts in San Juan (Puerto Rico) and Iquitos (Peru) using climate, environmental, and social data.

## 🔍 Problem
Forecast the weekly number of dengue cases using weather and behavioral signals.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Ridge Regression and XGBoost
- Time-aware train/test split and rolling cross-validation
- Feature engineering: lags, rolling averages, long-term trends
- External knowledge integration: public health interventions, hurricane events, migration
- Final model: XGBoost + Random Forest ensemble

## 🧪 Final Results

| City      | MAE     | RMSE   |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Iquitos   | ~9.19   | ~13–14 |
| San Juan  | ~14.5–15 (blended) | ~52.2 |
| **Combined MAE** | ~13.0 | — |
